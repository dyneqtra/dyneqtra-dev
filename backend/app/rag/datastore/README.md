# Datastore Module

This module is adapted from the [ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin datastore implementation](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/tree/main/datastore).

We considered using a Git submodule to include the original code, but decided against it for two main reasons:

1. Simplicity - Direct inclusion makes the codebase more straightforward to work with
2. Update Frequency - The original repository has infrequent updates, reducing the benefits of using a submodule

The code has been modified and integrated directly into this codebase while maintaining attribution to the original source.
