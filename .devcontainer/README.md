# Development Container Configuration

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/pyspur-dev/pyspur)

This directory contains configuration files for Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces. Dev containers provide a consistent, isolated development environment for this project.

## Contents

- `devcontainer.json` - The main configuration file that defines the development container settings
- `Dockerfile` - Defines the container image and development environment

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- Docker installation:
  - Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS)
  - Docker Engine (Linux)
- [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for VS Code

### Getting Started

1. Open this project in Visual Studio Code
2. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"
   - Alternatively, press `F1` and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"
3. Wait for the container to build and initialize
4. Launch the application using:
   ```bash
   dcup
   ```
5. Access the application (assuming the ports are forwarded as is to the host machine)
   - Main application: http://localhost:6080
   - Frontend development server: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000

The development environment will be automatically configured with all necessary tools and extensions.

### Viewing Logs

You can monitor the application logs using these commands:

- View all container logs:
  ```bash
  dlogs
  ```
- View backend logs only:
  ```bash
  dlogb
  ```
- View frontend logs only:
  ```bash
  dlogf
  ```
- View nginx logs only:
  ```bash
  dlogn
  ```

All log commands show the last 5 minutes of logs and continue to tail new entries.

### Modifying the database schemas


1. **Stop Containers**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

2. **Generate a Migration**
   ```bash
   ./generate_migrations.sh 002 <short_description_in_snake_case>
   ```
   - Migration file appears in `./backend/app/models/management/alembic/versions/` with prefix `002_...`.

3. **Review the Generated Script**
   - Open the file to ensure it has the intended changes.

4. **Apply the Migration**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   - Alembic applies the new migration automatically on startup.

5. **Test the App**
   - Confirm new tables/columns work as expected.

6. **Commit & Push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add migration 002 <description>"
   git push origin <branch>
   ```


### Docker commands

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up --build
```

## Customization

You can customize the development environment by:

- Modifying `devcontainer.json` to:
  - Add VS Code extensions
  - Set container-specific settings
  - Configure environment variables
- Updating the `Dockerfile` to:
  - Install additional packages
  - Configure system settings
  - Add development tools

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Rebuild the container: `F1` â†’ "Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container"
2. Check Docker logs for build errors
3. Verify Docker Desktop is running
4. Ensure all prerequisites are installed
